# **Supply Chain Forecasting Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning**

## **Overview**
This project applies machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to tackle key supply chain challenges like sales forecasting, inventory management, and replenishment optimization. The project aims to identify the most accurate models for predicting sales, reducing warehousing costs, and improving decision-making in supply chain management.
